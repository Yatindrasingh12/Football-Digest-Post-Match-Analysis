Description : Sky Sports Channel's coverage of the FIFA World Cup includes a postmatch TV program called "Football Digest: Post Match Analysis". The 
Football Pundits on the show discusses about the insights and game 
play as per their expertise and insights derived by the Sports Analyst at 
the backend. The Sports Analyst is responsible for analyzing data from 
each match to provide detailed statistics on the program related to the 
FIFA World Cup in Qatar and hand it over to the presenter and pundits 
of the "Football Digest: Post Match Analysis".

In our case study, we have two tables, group_stage_team_stats and 
overall_wc_stats that are being used by the Sports Analyst at Sky 
Sports Channel to provide detailed statistics and insights on the FIFA 
World Cup matches. The first table, group_stage_team_stats, which 
contains information on each team's performance in each game, has 
columns such as team name, game date, goals scored, goals 
conceded, shots on target, shots off target, possession, and many 
more. The second table, overall_wc_stats , which contains overall 
statistics of each team at the current FIFA World Cup, has columns 
such as player name, position, number of appearances, goals scored, 
assists, yellow and red cards, and other relevant information. With 
both tables being updated after each match, the analyst is able to 
extract valuable insights into the game, highlighting key moments, 
performances, and tactical decisions made by the coaches. Both the 
tables contain a column team, which is common and can be used for 
joining.
